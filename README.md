# PHPtest
This repo contains all the files I had to create to complete the assignment
Procedure of how to run the assignment:
1.We need a web server installed on our local machine(in my case it is XAMPP)
2.We need to use a database(in my case it is MySQL and I have done it through PHPmyadmin)
3.We need to create a database(registration in my case) in which we need to create a table(users in my case)with fields(6 in my case).
4.we need to access the localhost to run the application.As soon we we open the application index.html will be opened where we need to feed data to the tablein the database.
5.After successful insertion we the users can login.
Features of the application:
1.One who is not an authentiacted user cannot login.
2.Without logging in none can access welcome page.
3.No one can access logout page.User will be logged out only after clicking on the logout button i.e. present on the welcome page.
